# HawDict #

HawDict creates offline versions of popular Hawaiian dictionaries in a variety of digital dictionary formats.

By default all files produced by HawDict will use the proper Unicode characters for the [ʻokina](http://www.olelo.hawaii.edu/olelo/puana/okina.php) and [kahakōs](http://www.olelo.hawaii.edu/olelo/puana/kahako.php): `ʻ ā ē ī ō ū Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū`. However, for (typically older) dictionary formats where these characters cannot be used, HawDict will substitute ASCII instead: `' a e i o u A E I O U`.

For help building/running HawDict and/or using the created dictionaries, please see the [HawDict Wiki](https://github.com/jonthysell/HawDict/wiki).
